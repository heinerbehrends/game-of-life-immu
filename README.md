# Game-of-life-immu

Game-of-life-immu is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The UI is implemented using the React library. State management is done using the Redux package. The application uses pure functions and [immutable Lists](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/) to update the application state.
